d-suite is a collection of software and services founded and hosted by [@intergrav](https://github.com/intergrav)

### software

- [bot](https://github.com/d-suite/bot) is the monorepo for d-suite discord bots (maintainers: [@intergrav](https://github.com/intergrav))
- [art](https://github.com/d-suite/art) is the artwork for d-suite (maintainers: [@intergrav](https://github.com/intergrav))

### services

we have a lot of ideas but we plan on possibly hosting a Mastodon/Fediverse instance in the futureâ„¢ - no promises though. it's unlikely that we'll be hosting a git instance since there are many drawbacks to that
